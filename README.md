# odin-recipes
We are starting a new project called 'odin recipes' which will contain the following:
a set of recipes which you ca scroll through explore them
to build such a website we are going to need to use some of our new set of skills we learned.
Skills we'll be using:
HTML
git
CSS
we'll be starting with some HTML to build the structure of the website then we'll include the information for the website which will be the recipes and possibly the step by step instructions on how to make them.
